# SignBridge Project - Unified Backend Refactor

## Project Overview

This document outlines the complete refactoring of the SignBridge Indian Sign Language project from a messy, incomplete structure to a clean, production-ready Flask backend.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Structure Cleanup ✅
- **Removed broken/unused components:**
  - Deleted `data/`, `functions/`, `models/` folders from BackEnd
  - Removed incomplete FastAPI pipelines: `BrailleConversionPipeline`, `CourseMaterialPipeline`, `SpeechToSignPipeline`, `TextSummarizationPipeline`
  - Cleaned up obsolete startup scripts: `start_services.py`, `start_services_new.py`, `test_services.py`

- **Preserved working components:**
  - Retained `TextToSignPipeline/` and `SignDetectionPipeline/` for resources
  - Kept `shared/` folder for any useful utilities
  - Maintained sign images and model files

### 2. Unified Flask Backend ✅
- **Created modular Flask application:**
  - `BackEnd/app.py` - Main Flask application with factory pattern
  - `BackEnd/config.py` - Centralized configuration with environment support
  - `BackEnd/run.py` - Single entry point for starting the backend

- **Implemented Blueprint architecture:**
  - `blueprints/text_to_sign.py` - Text-to-sign conversion endpoints
  - `blueprints/sign_detection.py` - YOLO-based sign detection endpoints
  - Clean separation of concerns with modular design

### 3. Core Features Integration ✅
- **Text-to-Sign Service:**
  - Extracted working logic from `text-to-sign/app.py`
  - Implemented asynchronous video generation with progress tracking
  - Added text summarization capabilities
  - Support for customizable video parameters (FPS, duration, size)
  - Background processing with task status tracking

- **Sign Detection Service:**
  - Integrated YOLO model from `realtime_inference.py`
  - Implemented advanced preprocessing pipeline (bilateral filter, CLAHE, skin segmentation)
  - Real-time detection with temporal smoothing
  - Support for both single image and streaming detection
  - Fallback model support for robustness

### 4. API Endpoints ✅
All endpoints follow REST conventions with proper error handling:

#### Text-to-Sign (`/api/v1/text-to-sign/`)
- `POST /convert` - Start text-to-sign conversion
- `GET /status/{task_id}` - Check conversion progress
- `GET /download/{task_id}` - Download generated video
- `GET /available-letters` - Get available sign letters
- `GET /health` - Service health check

#### Sign Detection (`/api/v1/sign-detection/`)
- `POST /detect` - Detect signs in uploaded image
- `POST /detect-realtime` - Real-time detection for streaming
- `GET /model/info` - YOLO model information
- `POST /reset-history` - Reset prediction smoothing history
- `GET /configuration` - Get detection settings
- `GET /health` - Service health check

### 5. Configuration Management ✅
- **Environment-based configuration:**
  - `.env` file for environment variables
  - Separate configs for development/production/testing
  - Centralized settings in `config.py`

- **Key configuration features:**
  - CORS setup for frontend integration
  - File paths for models and resources
  - API keys and security settings
  - Firebase deployment configuration

### 6. Frontend Integration ✅
- **Updated React services:**
  - Modified `textToSignService.ts` to use new unified endpoints
  - Created `signDetectionService.ts` for detection features
  - Environment-based API URL configuration
  - Comprehensive TypeScript types for API responses

- **Cross-origin support:**
  - Proper CORS headers for all endpoints
  - Support for multiple frontend URLs (dev/production)
  - Preflight request handling

### 7. Production Readiness ✅
- **Error handling:**
  - Comprehensive exception handling in all endpoints
  - Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
  - Graceful fallbacks for missing resources

- **Logging:**
  - Structured logging with configurable levels
  - File-based logs with rotation
  - Request/response logging for debugging

- **Testing:**
  - Complete test suite with pytest
  - Unit tests for all major components
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - Test fixtures and mock data

### 8. Deployment Support ✅
- **Multiple deployment options:**
  - Traditional server deployment with Gunicorn
  - Firebase Functions integration
  - Docker containerization support
  - Local development setup

- **Firebase configuration:**
  - Updated `firebase.json` for proper deployment
  - Functions framework integration
  - Environment variable handling
